## An interesting Article on SWE

## Why is it interesting? 
As a student, there aren't a lot of experiences within the school's program to write production code, or learn to use frameworks, new collaborate in teams to work on software projects. Learning new technologies in school is very much based on classes. If I were to learn outside, it'd either be an internship, hackathon or personal project. In school, the most we have are deadlines, whereas for work, I'd always think deadlines are set and dead but apparently it's not according to the article. 

When I first started on my internship, I had to learn a completely new lanaguge and I was only 3 courses in, picking it up wasn't easy. What I found interesting from the article is that apparently, this is quite normal, and that miscalulating completion estimation is not uncommon. I love how he saw software development as a process of discovery. In school, there were answeres to the algorithms problems, or the data structures tests we took, yet in real life, often times, there aren't "model answers" to writing production code. And that different people take different amounts of time to pick up new things! 

## Comment - Charmaine Chan 
Just like Melody, I loved how he said building software is a process of discovery. There is so much room for improvement and changes as the project evolves. Thus, the importance of Agile and its methodologies. He says, "The goal is to incorporate healthy doses of customer feedback throughout the development process to get a better sense of where the product is headed and write code in a way that minimizes waste later on." Using the Agile approach, software developers can save time and write code in an more efficient way.
